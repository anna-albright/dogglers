This is app for our canine friends, called Dogglers. Your task is to implement Dogglers, which shows scrolling lists of dogs along with a bit of information about each one, such as their name, age, hobbies, and a photo. In this project I built layouts for the RecyclerView items in the Dogglers app, and implement an adapter so that the list of dogs can be presented three ways: by horizontal scrolling, vertical scrolling, and vertically scrolling grid layout.
